imperative programming is a style that uses statements that change a programâ€™s state&amp;hellip; focuses on describing HOW a program operates.
declarative programming is a style that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow&amp;hellip; focuses on describing WHAT the program should accomplish in terms of the problem domain.
When we read the definition of something, we tend to focus on terms that are already familiar to us, and then use those terms as a metaphor in order to understand the definition.</description></item></channel></rss>
