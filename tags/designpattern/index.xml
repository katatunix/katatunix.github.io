There have been a lot of related articles you can find on the Internet. Still, most of them are so math-intensive that we as software developers (we aren&rsquo;t good at math) don&rsquo;t want to read. So please give me a try to explain monads to you. I think they are worth knowing about. No math knowledge is required. What I want from you is just a basic knowledge of programming with types and functions.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How to think about MVC, MVP, PM, and MVVM?</title><link>/posts/2016/03-17-how-to-think-about-mvc-mvp-pm-and-mvvm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Nghia</author><guid>/posts/2016/03-17-how-to-think-about-mvc-mvp-pm-and-mvvm/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is about my personal explanation of the famous design patterns: Model View Controller (MVC), Model View Presenter (MVP), Presentation Model (PM), and Model View ViewModel (MVVM).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GoF Builder Pattern</title><link>/posts/2016/03-14-gof-builder-pattern/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Nghia</author><guid>/posts/2016/03-14-gof-builder-pattern/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Builder Pattern and Factory Pattern are pretty similar in a way: both of them encapsulate the details of object-creation processes. However, in cases there are many complicated processes to create various representations of objects, and those processes share a common trait, Builder Pattern is the better choice.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have two processes to build a house: Asian process and European one. We will start with Factory Pattern and gradually adapt it to Builder Pattern. A possible implementation of Factory Pattern could be:</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Why object persistence is hard?</title><link>/posts/2016/02-28-why-object-persistence-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Nghia</author><guid>/posts/2016/02-28-why-object-persistence-is-hard/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Object persistence &ndash; for example, saving/loading objects to/from a database &ndash; is easy, especially when using an ORM framework.
