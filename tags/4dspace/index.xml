Quote Little did they know that the universe is four dimensional and even the orbit of planets is an illusion produced when straight motion in a four dimensional space is projected into three dimensions (or something). immediately reminded me about projective geometry which is one of the most beautiful systems of mathematics.
So the universe is 4D? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. But if it was true then we could use the concepts of projective geometry to interpret something interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
