There have been a lot of related articles you can find on the Internet. Still, most of them are so math-intensive that we as software developers (we aren&amp;rsquo;t good at math) don&amp;rsquo;t want to read. So please give me a try to explain monads to you. I think they are worth knowing about. No math knowledge is required.</description></item></channel></rss>
