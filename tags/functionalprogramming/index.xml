There have been a lot of related articles you can find on the Internet. Still, most of them are so math-intensive that we as software developers (we aren&rsquo;t good at math) don&rsquo;t want to read. So please give me a try to explain monads to you. I think they are worth knowing about. No math knowledge is required. What I want from you is just a basic knowledge of programming with types and functions.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
